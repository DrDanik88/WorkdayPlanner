# Work Day Scheduler


## Description

- What was your motivation?
I wanted to created something using JQuery. This project was given to us, with the right CSS and HTML but with a completely blank JSS file. Using JQuery was much easier and stright forward.
- Why did you build this project? (
This project was created to make a simple workday planner. It's super simple. But using this starting JQuery code, you could add more days, a switcher, and maybe Jsonify everyday into one single key and parsing this back into the days. 

I designed this in a way that has many more lines of codes than it should. It's not the most optimized thing, but it is modular enought to be easily modified. You will find a TON of comments. 

Also, I have chosent to use the browser time instead of Jstime API. It was simpler to achieve using the timezone of the browser.

## Features
The hours are colored by the hour. 
Gray= Task time has passed
Red= This is the current time
Green = Tasks for the future

## Installation
Just copy the git on your computer and check the console if you need it. There are many more debugs inside the code you can enable at will.
